# ANSWER 1

###### [16,21,11,8,12,22] first step is sorthing so we have to divide the list as two part until to reach just one.

* [16,21,11] &nbsp; * [8,12,22]
* [16,21] &nbsp; * [11] &nbsp; * [8,12] &nbsp; * [22]
* [11,16,21] &nbsp; * [8,12,22]
* [8,11,12,16,21,22] 

###### Process that is realized n/2 + n/4 .... + 1

We can calculate big o notation like this 

O(n) but when we figure out to all process we found it 2x=n = logn

so briefly we can say O(nlogn) 

# ANSWER 2

Big O notation is O(nlogn)
